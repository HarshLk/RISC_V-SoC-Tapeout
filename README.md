# RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program

## Program Overview

This repository contains documentation and progress tracking for the **SoC Tapeout Program VSD**, a comprehensive initiative focused on designing System-on-Chip (SoC) architectures using RISC-V technology. The program covers the complete journey from basic RTL design to GDSII implementation utilizing open-source tools and methodologies.

### About the Program

The SoC Tapeout Program is part of India's premier collaborative RISC-V tapeout initiative, designed to empower over 3500 participants in building silicon and advancing the nation's semiconductor ecosystem. This program bridges the gap between academic learning and industry-ready semiconductor design skills.
